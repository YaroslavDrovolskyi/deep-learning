This is a dynamic, full-body character illustration of [trigger] and a small brown mouse, set indoors.

[trigger] is a bipedal, anthropomorphic grey cat with white fur on his paws, muzzle, and the tip of his long, curved tail. He has large, expressive yellow eyes, pink inner ears, and a mischievous smile. He is leaning forward to shake the hand of the mouse with his right paw, while his left paw is hidden behind his back, gripping a large wooden mallet with a yellow and red head.

The small brown mouse stands on the right, looking up at [trigger] with a knowing, sly grin while shaking his paw. Hidden behind the mouse's back is a lit black bomb with a sparkling fuse.

The background depicts the corner of a room with a blue wall and a white baseboard. The floor consists of a red and white checkered tile pattern. A bright, stylized light source from the upper right casts soft shadows of the characters onto the wall behind them. The art style is a vibrant, modern 2D digital animation style featuring clean line work, bright colors, and smooth gradient shading that gives the characters a rounded, three-dimensional appearance.
