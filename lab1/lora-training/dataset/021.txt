This is a full-body character illustration of [trigger] walking through a kitchen with a determined and angry expression, rendered in a classic 2D hand-drawn animation style.

[trigger] is a bipedal, anthropomorphic grey cat with a light grey underbelly, a white muzzle, and large white-furred paws. He is depicted in a dynamic walking pose, leaning forward with his head held high and his brow deeply furrowed in a scowl. His eyes are narrowed, showing only small hints of yellow, and he has a small black nose with thin whiskers.

He is carrying two items: in his right paw, he holds a large, bulging yellow sack slung over his shoulder, and tucked under his left arm is a plunger with a bright red handle that sticks up behind his head. His tail is curved slightly upward as he strides across the room.

The background depicts a bright, simplified kitchen interior. The floor is made of light teal and white checkered tiles. In the background, there are pale yellow or cream-colored kitchen cabinets with simple horizontal handles and a large white refrigerator. The lighting is bright and flat, characteristic of vintage mid-century cartoons, with clean, bold black outlines defining the character and the environment.
