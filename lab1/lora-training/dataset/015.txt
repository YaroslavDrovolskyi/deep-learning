This is a full-body character illustration of [trigger], a bipedal anthropomorphic cat, standing in a confident and smug pose against a solid white background.

[trigger] is depicted with a lean, athletic build, primarily covered in blue-grey fur. He features high-contrast white fur on his large paws, his muzzle, and the tip of his upward-curving tail. A light grey, oval-shaped patch of fur covers his chest and belly. His facial expression is one of self-satisfaction, with wide yellow eyes, small green pupils, and a subtle, knowing smirk. His ears are large and pointed with pink inner ears, and he has long, thin black whiskers extending from his muzzle.

His posture is dominant and proud; he stands upright with his feet angled outward and his arms crossed tightly over his chest. The art style is a clean, modern 2D digital animation style, characterized by sharp black outlines and minimal, flat shading. The character design is streamlined and polished, emphasizing bold silhouettes and expressive facial features without complex textures or environmental distractions.
