A medium shot of [trigger] sitting comfortably in a plush red theater seat. [trigger] is an anthropomorphic cat with sleek blue-grey fur, a white muzzle, white hand-like paws, and a distinct white patch on his chest. He is sitting in a relaxed, cross-legged posture with his left hand resting casually on the dark reddish-brown armrest. His expression is happy and attentive, featuring a gentle smile and wide yellow eyes with small black pupils looking upwards to the right. He has long black whiskers and pointed ears with pink interiors. The background consists of the large, curved red backrest of the cinema chair and a dark, muted purple wall behind him, which features faint, blurry outlines of wall sconces or fixtures. The image has a classic 1950s hand-drawn cel animation aesthetic with flat colors and bold outlines.
