This image features a full-body character illustration of [trigger], a bipedal anthropomorphic cat, shown from a side profile in a playful and slightly flamboyant walking pose.

[trigger] is rendered in a classic 2D hand-drawn animation style with a predominantly blue-grey fur body. He has a white-furred muzzle, white paws, and a long tail that curves upward with a distinct white tip. His expression is one of pure smugness or delight; his eyes are closed, his brow is arched, and he wears a wide, gentle smile. He is depicted mid-stride, leaning back slightly with his chest puffed out, while his white-gloved paws are tucked behind his back in a jaunty fashion. Small black claws are slightly visible on his front paws.

The background consists of a simple, textured teal or seafoam green wall that shows subtle signs of wear and vertical paneling. [trigger] is walking atop a cluttered surface where a bright green object and the top of a red container are partially visible in the lower-left corner. In the lower-right, the neck of a glass bottle with a green stopper can be seen. The lighting is flat and even, typical of mid-century theatrical cartoons, with bold black outlines clearly defining the character against the more painterly, muted environment.
