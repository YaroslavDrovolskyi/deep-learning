This is a full-body character illustration of [trigger], a bipedal anthropomorphic cat, captured in a moment of extreme shock or terror against a solid white background.

[trigger] is rendered in a classic 2D animation style with thick, clean black outlines. He has a primarily grey fur body with a light-colored, creamy-grey underbelly. His large, expressive eyes feature yellow sclera and small green pupils, and they are wide with fright. His mouth is agape in a silent scream, revealing a large red tongue hanging out to the side.

His physical pose is highly dynamic and "rubbery": he is in a deep crouch with his legs spread wide, and his white-furred paws (both hands and feet) are oversized. He holds his hands up near his face with fingers splayed outward in a defensive, startled gesture. His tail is curved upward behind him, also tipped with white fur. The lighting is flat and consistent, typical of character model sheets or digital clip art, emphasizing his exaggerated facial expression and frantic body language.
