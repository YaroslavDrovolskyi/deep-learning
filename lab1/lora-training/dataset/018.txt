This is a full-body character illustration of [trigger] interacting with a small brown mouse, set against a plain, light beige background.

[trigger] is a bipedal, anthropomorphic grey cat with a cream-colored muzzle and underbelly. He is depicted in a jovial, welcoming pose with his arms spread wide and his white-gloved paws open. He has a wide, happy expression with an open-mouthed smile, large yellow eyes with small black pupils, and long black whiskers. His ears are pointed with pink interiors, and his tail, which has a white tip, curves slightly behind him.

Standing to the right is a small brown mouse with a similar joyful expression. The mouse also has its arms spread wide in a mirroring gesture, looking up at the cat with large, sparkling eyes and a wide smile.

The art style is a clean 2D digital animation style featuring bold, dark outlines and flat colors with very minimal, soft shading. The composition is centered, emphasizing the friendly interaction between the two characters. The background is entirely featureless, providing a neutral space that keeps the focus strictly on the character models and their expressive poses.
