This medium close-up shot depicts [trigger] and a small brown mouse peering over the edge of a wooden surface, set against a textured, light teal wall.

[trigger] is a bipedal anthropomorphic cat with blue-grey fur, a white muzzle, and large pointed ears with pink interiors. He is leaning forward with a smug, devious expression, resting his chin on his right white-furred paw. His left arm is bent at the elbow, with his paw resting on his hip. He has high-arched black eyebrows, large yellow eyes with green pupils looking toward the right, and thin black whiskers fanning out from his cheeks.

To the far right, a small brown mouse is partially visible, sharing the same mischievous and angry expression with furrowed brows as it looks in the same direction as the cat.

The background consists of a vertical-paneled wall in a muted teal or seafoam green color, showing subtle grain and wear. They are looking over a dark brown, grained wooden ledge or table edge. The art style is a classic 2D hand-drawn animation style, featuring soft color palettes, visible line work, and a grainier texture characteristic of vintage mid-century cartoons.
