This is a full-body character illustration of [trigger], a bipedal anthropomorphic cat, standing against a solid white background.

[trigger] is depicted with a lean, slender build and a playful, slightly sheepish expression. He has grey fur covering most of his body, with white fur on his paws, the tip of his tail, and a light-colored underbelly that extends from his chest down to his lower torso. His ears are large and pointed, with pink inner ears, and he has a pair of thin whiskers on each cheek. His eyes are wide with yellow sclera and small black pupils, looking off to the side, and he has a small black nose.

His posture is expressive; he is standing on his tiptoes with his feet close together, and his arms are bent at the elbows with his white-gloved paws held up near his chest in a delicate, hesitant gesture. His long, thin tail is curved slightly upward behind him. The art style is a modern 2D animation style characterized by clean, dark outlines and soft, subtle purple-to-blue gradient shading on his grey fur, giving the character a polished, Three-dimensional look within a flat medium.
