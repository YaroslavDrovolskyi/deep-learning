This is a full-body character illustration of [trigger] in a dynamic, playful pose, rendered in a classic 2D hand-drawn animation style.

[trigger] is a bipedal, anthropomorphic grey cat with a light grey underbelly, a white muzzle, and white-furred paws. He is depicted in a flexible, low-profile stretch or crawl across the top of a wooden object. His body is arched with his rear and tail held high, while his head and front paws are pressed low. He has a content, smug expression with his eyes closed, a small black nose, and thin whiskers. His ears are pointed with pink interiors, and his tail is curved upward with a distinct white tip. His white paws feature small, sharp black claws slightly extended as they grip the surface.

The background is a simple, textured teal or seafoam green wall that appears slightly aged or painted. [trigger] is positioned on top of a brown wooden barrel with dark metal bands. The lighting is soft and flat, consistent with mid-century theatrical cartoons, utilizing clean black outlines to define the character against the more softly textured background elements.
