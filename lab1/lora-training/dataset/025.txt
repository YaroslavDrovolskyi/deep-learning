This is a full-body character illustration of [trigger], a bipedal anthropomorphic cat, captured in a joyful and delicate movement against a solid teal background.

[trigger] is rendered in a classic 2D hand-drawn animation style with a primarily blue-grey fur body. He features a light grey or cream-colored underbelly and muzzle, with large pointed ears that have pink interiors. His expression is one of pure delight; his eyes are closed tight, and he has a wide, happy smile. He is depicted in a dynamic, light-footed pose, appearing to dance or step carefully on top of a wooden object.

His large white-furred paws are splayed outward with small, sharp black claws visible. His long tail curves upward behind him, ending in a distinct white tip. The lighting is soft and flat, consistent with mid-century theatrical cartoons, with clean black outlines defining the character against the slightly textured teal backdrop. [trigger] is standing on the curved wooden slats of a barrel, which is partially visible at the bottom of the frame.
