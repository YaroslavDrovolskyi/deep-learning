A medium close-up, high-angle shot of [trigger] in a formal tuxedo, set against a solid dark purple background.

[trigger] is a bipedal anthropomorphic cat with blue-grey fur, white fur on his muzzle and chest, and large pointed ears with pink interiors. He is looking upward and to the right with a pleasant, expectant expression, featuring wide yellow eyes with green pupils and a closed-mouth smile. His thin black whiskers are prominently fanned out from his cheeks.

He is dressed in a formal black tuxedo jacket with grey lapels over a white dress shirt, accented by a bright red bowtie. His right arm is extended upward and out of the frame, while his left arm is tucked behind his back. The lighting is soft and centered on the character, creating a subtle vignetting effect against the deep purple backdrop. The art style is classic 2D hand-drawn animation, characterized by clean black outlines, flat colors, and a smooth, polished aesthetic typical of mid-century theatrical cartoons.
