This is a full-body character illustration of [trigger], a bipedal anthropomorphic cat, shown from a side profile against a solid white background.

[trigger] is depicted with a lean, slightly hunched posture, expressing intense surprise or alarm. He is a grey-furred cat with a light grey or cream-colored underbelly and muzzle. His face features a wide-open mouth in a gasp, a small black nose, and a large, wide-open eye with a bright yellow sclera and a small black pupil. His ears are pointed with pink inner ears, and thin black whiskers protrude from his snout.

He stands in a partial crouch on his large, white-furred feet. His arms are positioned slightly away from his body with his white paws splayed open, fingers extended in a startled gesture. His tail is curved upward behind him, also featuring a white tip. The art style is a classic 2D hand-drawn animation style, utilizing clean, bold black outlines and flat coloring with very minimal shading, typical of mid-20th-century cartoon character models.
